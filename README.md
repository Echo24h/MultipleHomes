## Description
MultipleHomes is a versatile plugin for Minecraft that revolutionizes home management on your server. With its intuitive GUI interface, players can easily create and manage multiple homes with ease. The plugin seamlessly integrates with the economy system, allowing you to set prices for homes and implement dynamic pricing based on the number of homes owned.
